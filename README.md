Java Mini Project

Yeah!!!

Congrats for reaching this page :)

As this page contains the popular game called "Snake,Water and Gun"

Here are some details about the game 

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people.
It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using JAVA.
This java project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer .

Following are the rules of the game:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.

Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water.

Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a drawn.

You can choose how many match series do you want to play at the beginning to the code and at the end, the final result displays.

All the best !

Thank you 

Hope u Enjoy the Game :)
